# 📊 Restaurant Data Analysis - Summary

## 📝 Overview
This document summarizes the key findings and conclusions from the restaurant data analysis project. The project involved data exploration, feature engineering, geospatial analysis, and predictive modeling to understand factors influencing restaurant ratings.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration
- Missing values were handled effectively.
- The dataset was balanced in terms of rating distribution.
- Certain features like `Votes` and `Price Range` showed strong correlation with ratings.

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- New features such as **Review Strength** and **Price Sensitivity Score** were created.
- These engineered features improved the predictive power of the models.

### 3️⃣ Geospatial Analysis
- Certain cities had consistently higher-rated restaurants.
- Location plays a crucial role in restaurant ratings.
- Visualization with scatter maps highlighted clustering of high-rated restaurants in metropolitan areas.

### 4️⃣ Predictive Modeling
- Multiple machine learning models were tested, including **Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression**.
- **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting** performed the best, achieving the lowest RMSE.
- Hyperparameter tuning improved model accuracy further.

### 5️⃣ Insights & Recommendations
- **Restaurants with table booking tend to have better ratings.**
- **Higher price range restaurants generally receive higher ratings.**
- **Improving online delivery services** could boost ratings for lower-rated restaurants.
- **Future improvements:**
  - Implementing sentiment analysis on customer reviews.
  - Deploying the model using a web application for real-time predictions.
